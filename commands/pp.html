            <h1>Command: PP</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">"Points on Polyline" - Create Surveying Points at Regular Intervals on Linear Entities</p>
        </header>

        <section class="description">
            <h2>Purpose of the Command</h2>
            <p>
                The <code>PP</code> command is designed to automate the process of "staking out" points along a path within the AutoCAD environment. It accurately places AutoCAD Points on any linear entity, whether straight or curved, based on a user-defined interval.
            </p>
            <p>
                This command is an indispensable tool for surveyors and civil engineers when dealing with road layouts, utility lines (power, water, sewage), or any project that requires precise distance division.

            <h2>Workflow</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Invoke Command:</strong>
                    <p>Type the shortcut <code>PP</code> into the Command Line and press Enter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Select Entities:</strong>
                    <p>You will be prompted to "Select objects:". Select all the linear entities on which you want to distribute the points. You can select multiple different objects in a single operation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enter Interval Distance:</strong>
                    <p>You will be prompted to "Enter interval distance:". Enter the numerical value for the desired distance between each point. The distance is calculated along the true length of the entity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Process Data:</strong>
                    <p>The command processes the selected entities and automatically places the points. The points will appear directly on the drawing, typically on a dedicated layer.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Technical Specs & Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Entity Support:</strong> Works efficiently on Lines, Polylines, Arcs, Circles, and Splines.</li>
                <li><strong>Curve Accuracy:</strong> Ensures points are distributed correctly along the true length of curves and arcs, not along their chords, providing high surveying accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> You can select an unlimited number of objects at once, and the command will process them all in a single operation.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Efficiency:</strong> The algorithm is optimized to run quickly, even on large and complex drawings.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="example">
            <h2>Use Case</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> You have a 2.5 km pipeline route drawn as a Polyline, and you need to mark the locations of welding joints every 12 meters along the path.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Solution with <code>PP</code>:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>Run the <code>PP</code> command.</li>
                <li>Select the Polyline representing the pipeline.</li>
                <li>When prompted for the distance, enter <code>12</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> AutoCAD points will be instantly created along the path exactly every 12 meters, ready to be exported to a Total Station or used for generating drawings.</li>
            </ol>
